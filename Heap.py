HEAP
----
A heap queue or priority queue is a data structure that allows us to quickly access the smallest (min-heap)
or largest (max-heap) element. A heap is typically implemented as a binary tree, where each parent nodeâ€™s value is smaller
 (for a min-heap) or larger (for a max-heap) than its children. However, in Python,
heaps are usually implemented as min-heaps which means the smallest element is always at the root of the tree,
 making it easy to access.
